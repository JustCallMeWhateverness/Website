                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Persona:</b> Jules is the band's laid-back virtuoso, with an ear for creating hauntingly
                            beautiful, layered guitar solos. He's the quiet genius of the group, speaking more through
                            his guitar than his words.</li>

                            classical

                        <li><b>Instruments:</b> His prized possession is a Gibson Les Paul, heavily modified with custom
                            pickups for a rich, distorted sound that carries the band's signature tone.</li>
                    </ul>

                            bass
                            lines, and punk-rock energy. She's a charismatic performer who amps up the energy on stage
                            with her dance moves and crowd interactions.</li>

                            attitude, adding a unique dimension to the band's sound.</li>
                        <li><b>Style:</b> Known for her eclectic wardrobe—ripped fishnets, neon hair streaks, and an
                            array of
                            chains and piercings. Her bass is covered in stickers from various bands and activist
                            movements.</li>
                        <li><b>Instruments:</b> Plays a Fender Precision Bass, modified for deeper tones and accented
                            with a

                        <li><b>Style:</b> Always in dark, layered clothing—hoodies, beanies, and fingerless gloves that
                            match
                            his dark eyeliner. Off-stage, he's reserved, but on stage, he's all energy.</li>

                        <li><b>Overview:</b> Reverie is an introspective EP, exploring the band's more
                            experimental and ambient side. With only five tracks, it delves into themes of dreams,
                            subconscious fears, and existential musings, blending rock with ambient and electronic
                            influences. It feels like a temporary pause—a dreamlike interlude within their powerful
                            discography.
